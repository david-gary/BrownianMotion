# Brownian Motion Simulation

## Description

A quick visualization of Brownian motion across 1 and 2 dimensional space. This is about as mathematical as random scribbling can get.

## Setup

Assuming Python3 is already installed on your machine, running the `setup.sh` bash script will install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

If you experience issues with the script, try running the following command and run the script again.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

## Usage

To run the simulation again (or for the first time if you skipped the setup), run the following command.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The program will continuously generate simulations with newly randomized parameters. To quit, press `q` or click the close button in the top corner of your Matplotlib window.
